# Registration-Form

Project Overview

This project involves the development of a responsive, user-friendly, and accessible registration form for a hypothetical service. The form includes essential fields such as Name, Email, Password, Address, Date of Birth, Gender, and optional fields for Preferences, Interests, and Terms & Conditions.
The form is designed to be fully responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop screens. The form also includes client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure that all required fields are properly filled out before submission.

Features
1. Responsive Design: The form is optimized to work on different screen sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) using CSS media queries.
2. Required Fields: Fields like Name, Email, Password, and Date of Birth are required, and an asterisk (*) next to the label indicates these mandatory fields.
3. Client-Side Validation: JavaScript ensures data integrity by validating inputs before form submission.
4. Error Handling: If the form is incomplete or invalid, error messages are displayed to guide the user on correcting the input.
5. Terms and Conditions: A checkbox for agreeing to the terms and conditions. The form can't be submitted unless the user agrees.
6. Interactive Form: User-friendly interface with placeholder text and clear instructions in form fields.

Additional Information
1. Mobile-Friendly:
- The form is optimized for mobile screens with proper layout scaling and input field sizes to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

2. Accessible:
- Semantic HTML elements (like labels, form groups, and appropriate aria attributes) are used to enhance accessibility. This ensures the form can be used by screen readers and other assistive technologies.

3. JavaScript Validation:
- The form is equipped with JavaScript for validation, including checking if required fields are filled and ensuring proper email format and password length. It prevents form submission if validation fails.
